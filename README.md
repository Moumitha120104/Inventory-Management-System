# Inventory Management System

  The Inventory Management System is a comprehensive automobile website with dual views for clients and administrators. The client interface operates as a typical e-commerce platform, enabling user registration, login, product selection, cart management, and order placement. Clients can monitor their order status, distinguishing between complete, shipped, or in-progress orders.

On the admin side, the system provides robust inventory management capabilities. Admins can perform CRUD operations on products, oversee employee and supplier details, and track all inventory parts. The system offers real-time insights into storage quantities, automatically triggering supplier orders when inventory levels fall below a defined threshold.

When a client places an order, the admin interface displays the order details. In case of insufficient inventory, the system initiates an order with the supplier. Admins manually accept the produced quantity after the restock time. The system ensures seamless coordination between client orders and inventory restocking.

Moreover, the admin dashboard features statistical analysis tools, presenting visualizations that facilitate a deeper understanding of inventory-related relationships and financial metrics. Admins can assess profits and losses through intuitive charts. The system provides additional insights, such as the number of clients, suppliers, and other relevant information within the inventory.

In summary, the Inventory Management System streamlines the client's shopping experience while empowering administrators with comprehensive tools to manage and optimize inventory, suppliers, and overall business performance.
